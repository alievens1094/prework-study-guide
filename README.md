# <Prework study guide webpage>

## Description

To create a prework study guide websit to look back at what was learned throughout the prework. This was built as something to continue to look back on in the future when questions arise. This allows all of the notes to be easily accessible and all in one location. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a README file.

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
